  <p>It's economical, it's fun, it's delicious. <strong>BUT</strong> if baking is not for you, <em>that's okay</em>! Thankfully, there are people out there like me! People who:</p>

    I've found this <a href="http://www.wakeandbakecookbook.com/decarboxylating-cannabis-to-activate-thc/">article</a> particularly helpful for starting out.

      The writer is enjoyable, true. But the website just.. <strong>pops.</strong> Granted that could be all the pretty pictures of weed. However I do find it a bit cluttered. For example: the ability to share the article is great, and essential for promotion. But does it need to be both at the end of the article (when scrolled to) <em>and</em> on the left side of the page (the whole time)? It seems a little redundant and pushy.
